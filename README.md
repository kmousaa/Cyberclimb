CyberClimb is an immersive platformer where players ascend while avoiding mobs and traps. Each level is procedurally generated, offering endless replayability. The unique aspect of the game is that every conquered level can be won as a valuable non-fungible token (NFT), providing a tangible reward for your achievements.
